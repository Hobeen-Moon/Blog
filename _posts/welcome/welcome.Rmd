As part of the senior project, I had create a blog. There are many different tools that you could use to create a blog, but I chose distill package in R to create my blog. I Would like to show how I created this blog using distill package in R with github.

First, open R studio and install distill package. 

`install.packages("distill")`

Next, go to github.com and create new repository.

After you create your repository, copy the URL of your repository and open R Studio. In R Studio, create a new project. When creating a new project, choose version control and choose git options.

After creating a new project, run the following command to create a blog using distill package.
`distill::create_blog(dit = getwd(), title = "Your Blog Name")`
dir command let you choose where you want to create a blog. in this case, I'm creating a blog file to my current working directory and that is why I'm using getwd(). You can change the name of your blog in *title*.

After you run the command and the blog files are created, you need to restart the R Studio.

After you restart your R studio, you can find a *Build* tab on your right top corner of R Studio. Click Build tab and click Build Website.
